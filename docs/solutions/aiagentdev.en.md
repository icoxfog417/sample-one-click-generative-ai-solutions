## Deploy to AWS

Click the button below to deploy. Please log in to AWS first.

### Parameter Configuration

You can configure the following parameters during deployment:

- **UserEmail** (Required)
    - User's email address. Used for Git configuration and Code Server username.
    - Deployment completion notifications will be sent to this address.
- **UserFullName** (Default: AIAgent Developer)
    - Full name used for Git configuration.
- **InstanceType** (Default: t4g.large)
    - EC2 instance type. Uses ARM64 architecture (Graviton) instances. Use the following as a guide for performance and pricing. We recommend checking the [latest pricing information](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/). Consider m7g/c7g if you need a higher-performance environment.
    - t4g.medium: 2 vCPU + 4GB memory, approximately $0.72/24 hours (not recommended for running agents)
    - t4g.large: 2 vCPU + 8GB memory, approximately $1.68/24 hours (default)
    - t4g.xlarge: 4 vCPU + 16GB memory, approximately $3.12/24 hours (for heavy container builds)
    - t4g.2xlarge: 8 vCPU + 32GB memory
    - On memory: code-server, an agent CLI session, a local agent started by `agentcore dev` and Docker all run at the same time. 4GB (t4g.medium) risks an out-of-memory hang, so 8GB or more is recommended.
- **InstanceVolumeSize** (Default: 40)
    - EBS volume size in GB.
- **HomeFolder** (Default: /workshop)
    - Working directory path. This is where repositories will be cloned.
- **RepoUrl** (Default: https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-amazon-bedrock-agentcore-onboarding.git)
    - Git repository URL to automatically clone.
- **EnableAdministratorAccess** (Default: false)
    - Whether to attach the AdministratorAccess policy to the EC2 instance role. Set to `true` if you need to manage AWS resources from the IDE, such as CDK bootstrap and deploy.

### Post-Deployment Setup

After clicking the deploy button, you will receive an email titled `AI Agent Dev Code Server Deployment Notifications - Subscription Confirmation`. Click the `Confirm subscription` link to receive deployment completion notifications.

Once deployment is complete, access the browser-based development environment using the URL provided in the notification email and log in with the password.

* The password can be found in the CloudFormation Outputs
* Enable Amazon Bedrock models as needed
* Kiro CLI is pre-configured. To use it, authenticate with `kiro-cli login --use-device-flow`

### Development Environment Features

The development environment comes with the following pre-installed tools:

- **AWS Tools**: AgentCore CLI (`agentcore`), AWS CLI v2, AWS SAM CLI, Kiro CLI
- **AI Coding Tools**: Kiro CLI, Claude Code (`claude`)
- **Development Tools**: Git, Docker, Python, UV, NVM (Node.js LTS, NPM)
- **Editor**: Code-Server (bundled with the Claude Code extension; no other extensions are installed by default, to keep disk usage minimal)

Environment variables are automatically configured:

- `AWS_REGION` - Deployed region
- `AWS_ACCOUNTID` - AWS account ID

### Security

- Direct access to EC2 instances is restricted; only accessible via CloudFront
- Security groups allow only CloudFront Prefix List (configured per region)
- Passwords are securely managed in AWS Secrets Manager
- EBS volumes are encrypted
- Management access via SSM Session Manager

## Cost

Main costs come from the following resources:

- **EC2 Instance** - Charged based on t4g.large (2 vCPU, 8GB memory) runtime (approximately $1.68 for 24 hours on-demand)
- **EBS Volume** - 40GB (default) gp3 storage charges
- **CloudFront** - Charged based on data transfer volume
- **Other** - Minimal costs for VPC, Secrets Manager, SNS, etc.

You can reduce costs by stopping the EC2 instance when not in use. However, CloudFront and EBS volumes continue to incur charges even when stopped.


## Resource Cleanup

To terminate usage, delete the stack from the CloudFormation console:

1. Access the [CloudFormation Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)
2. Select the deployed stack (default: `AIAgentDevDeploymentStack`)
3. Click the "Delete" button

!!! warning "Deletion Notes"
    - Deleting the stack will also delete the EC2 instance and EBS volume
    - Back up any work in progress or data beforehand
    - Secrets Manager secrets will be deleted but have a recovery period (default 30 days)

## Additional Resources

Amazon Bedrock Agent Core hands-on is configured by default. For details, see the [README.md](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-amazon-bedrock-agentcore-onboarding).
